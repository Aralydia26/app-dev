| A teenage special ops agent coveting a "normal" adolescence fakes her own death and enrolls in a suburban high school. She quickly learns that surviving the treacherous waters of high school is more challenging than international espionage.|
| Megan Walsh has been training to be an international assassin for Hardman. However, while she is on a mission, she notices how other teenagers her age seem to be having fun and enjoying their lives. Desiring a normal life, she bails out of a mission and enrolls in a student exchange program, while in the process of being adopted by a foster family. She soon becomes a part of the high school and is subjected to the pressures and life of being in its environment.|
